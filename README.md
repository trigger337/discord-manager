# discord-manager

A bash script to manage Discord and BetterDiscord installations.

This is a handy tool I created to manage Discord installations, as I was tired of downloading it every time it updated and found the Flatpak version unsatisfactory.

Please note that this project is a work in progress, and it will improve over time.

**WARNING**: The code might not be up to standard and may cause cringing.
